<p><strong>About Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Unit in Department of Chemistry</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the 8th Malaysian Plan (2001-2006), GMO Unit was set up&nbsp; to fulfil the needs arising from the proposed amendments to the Food Regulations 1985, which plan to make mandatory labelling of GMOs found in food. Under the implementation of Malaysia&rsquo;s National Biosafety Framework project, the National GMO Laboratory under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment was developed specifically for the analysis of genetic modified organisms and their potential impact on the environment and human health. Since its beginning GMO Unit has been involved with food and feed testing and remains a National GMO laboratory for GMO in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2004, this laboratory is designated as the ASEAN Reference Laboratory (ARL) for GMO testing during the ASEAN Workshop and Expert Consultation, which was held on 07-11 June 2004, in Jakarta.</p>
