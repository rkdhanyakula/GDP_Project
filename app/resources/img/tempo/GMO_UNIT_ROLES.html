<p><strong>Capacity building</strong></p>
<p>One of the tasks of the Department of Chemistry, Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation (DOC, MOSTI) is to provide training in advanced methods for the detection, identification and quantification of GMO in raw materials for the production of food and feed stuff as well as in finished food and feed products.</p>
<p>We also organise workshops, training sessions and conferences that we organise in order to foster international collaboration and harmonisation in GMO-analysis in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>History: Since 2002, the GMO unit, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, EURL-GMFF, MARDI and other institutions, has conducted a series of trainings on the analysis of food and feed samples for the presence of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), their identification and quantification. The scope covered analytical biotechnology skills required for GMO testing, the proper implementation of facilities and expertise, and the promotion of using method that are validated and harmonised.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>GMO testing Service</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, an economical qualitative GMO test to confirm the presence or absence of GMOs will suffice. Only if the qualitative GMO test result is positive will a more expensive quantitative GMO test be required.</p>
<p>When quantitation is required, a range of GMO testing options is available.</p>
<p>Variety identification tests can be customized to your export destination, saving your money while assuring compliance with import regulations.</p>
<p>DOC, MOSTI offers a wide range of GMO tests accredited to ISO17025 standard that can be customized to meet your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of tests available</strong></p>
<p>GMO Qualitative Analysis reports presence or absence of GMO, but will not quantify how much GMO is present. Limit of detection is 0.1%.</p>
<p>GMO Real-Time Quantitative Analysis reports the quantitative results of GMO content. Limit of detection is 0.1% and limit of quantification is 0.5%.</p>
<p>If a sample requires more than one GMO test, the additional GMO testing fees may be reduced provided no further DNA extraction is required.</p>
